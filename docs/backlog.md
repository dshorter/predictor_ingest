## Extraction & Prompt Tuning

### EXT-1: Entity type definitions missing from LLM prompt

**Observed:** 2026-02-21 | **Priority:** Medium (accumulate data first)

The system prompt lists entity types as a bare enum with no definitions,
examples, or disambiguation rules. The GLOSSARY.md has good descriptions
but they never reach the prompt. This causes inconsistent classification:

- **Model vs Tool** — "ChatGPT" tagged as Model in one doc, Tool in another
- **Tech vs Topic** — "machine learning" could go either way
- **Tech vs Model** — "LLMs" classified as both `tech:llms` and `model:llms`

**Likely fix:** Inject GLOSSARY definitions + disambiguation rules into
`build_extraction_system_prompt()` in `src/extract/__init__.py` (~line 237).
Also need entity resolution to merge duplicates already created.

**Waiting on:** More days of pipeline output to see the full pattern of
misclassifications before tuning.
