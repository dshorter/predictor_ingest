# RSS feeds for AI trend graph ingestion
# Runtime configuration - parsed by src/ingest/rss.py

# Per-feed `limit` caps items ingested per run (0 = unlimited).
# The CLI --limit flag overrides per-feed limits when set.

# tier: 1 = primary/original source, 2 = secondary/aggregator, 3 = echo/mainstream
# signal: what kind of signal this source provides
#   primary    — original announcements, papers, releases
#   commentary — analysis, synthesis, interpretation
#   echo       — re-reports primary source content (creates overlap for velocity)
#   community  — practitioner attention, adoption signals
